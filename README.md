# Monument_Identification_Deep_Learning

This project aims at predicting Indian monuments of Heritage Importance using techniques of Deep learning and is built using Python programming language.
The major libraries used are Streamlit for making the frontend design and fast Api is used at the back end for serving requests regarding Prediction.

Further I have made use of Kaggle to collect the datasets regarding Indian Monuments  and then use a CNN Neural Network Architecture to train the model by feeding the datasets.

Once model training is complete then you can use  the web application for correct prediction of Monuments. The h5 file in this repo contains the model trained dataset.
